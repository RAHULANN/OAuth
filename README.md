# User Authentication System

This is a user authentication system that allows users to sign up, sign in, sign out, reset their password, and use Google login/signup for social authentication. The system ensures that passwords are securely stored in the database by encrypting them. Additionally, it includes a bonus feature for password recovery in case a user forgets their password.
